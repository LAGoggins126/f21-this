document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
	// 1) Retrieve the "button" elements from the DOM and store them in a variable


	// 2) Create a function that retrieves the "data-color" attribute's value of
	//    the pre-existing "this" object, and set the body's background color to
	//    the new color value


	// 3) Use either the Array.forEach method or a for...of loop to attach a mouse
	//    click event listener to each "button" element in your variable from (1),
	//    and supply it with (2)'s function as the callback function


	// 4) Create a new "Person" object constructor function that:
	//    - Takes a name and an age as parameters and stores them on the object
	//      as properties using the "this" keyword (you can name the properties
	//      the same as the parameters or give them unique identifiers)
	//    - Also using the "this" keyword, add a method to your object called
	//      "speak" which does the following:
	//      - Uses another "this" keyword to console log the "Person" object's
	//        own name and age


	// 5) Create two different "Person" objects with different names and ages and
	//    store them in an array


	// 6) Loop through the array calling "speak" on each "Person" object in
	//    (5)'s array
